            <p>Like many other forms of business communication, presentations should have three distinct phases: the opening, the body, and the closing.</p>
            <p>Let's start with your opening. Ideally, your opening should capture the audience's attention, establish rapport with them, and build your credibility.</p> 
            <p>Of the following, which would be the most appropriate opening?</p>

                An easy way to get your audience's attention and get them engaged is to ask them a question that is relevant to your presentation. Keep in mind that you'll now need to address how the reorganization is going to tie into the rest of your presentation, such as how the new organization is going to make them specialists in a product line.            </span>
