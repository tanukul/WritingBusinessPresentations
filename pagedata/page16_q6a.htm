            <p>Like many other forms of business communication, presentations should have three distinct phases: the opening, the body, and the closing.</p>
            <p>Let's start with your opening. Ideally, your opening should capture the audience's attention, establish rapport with them, and build your credibility.</p>

                Although humor can build rapport with your audience, jokes are often inauthentic, because they're not your words. Additionally, at least some members of your audience may perceive it as a time-waster and develop a sudden distaste for you as a presenter.
