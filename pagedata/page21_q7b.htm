                </span>
                Reading requires you to look at your script, not your audience, and if you do look up occasionally, it's easy to lose your place. Additionally, reading limits your interaction with the audience, and your delivery will lack a conversational tone. Another choice would have been a better option.        </p>

                </span>Although memorizing your speech will allow you to maintain eye contact with the audience, your speech will probably lack a conversational tone, because all spontaneity will be gone. Additionally, mind blanks can (and often do) happen, and then your entire speech will fall apart.

                    </span>
                    If you're an experienced speaker and you know your topic well, you'll be able to maintain eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your message. However, if you have a fear of public speaking, this approach isn't for you. Additionally, because your only "cue card" is your outline, the detailed points will have to come from your mind, and you may be bombarded with so many thoughts that you're likely to forget some of them or interject forgotten items later in the speech where they're no longer relevant, resulting in an unorganized delivery.        </p>

                </span>
                Having notes takes the pressure off from having to remember every point, as well as the order and flow of what you are presenting. Having notes also provides you with a "security blanket." If you don't need to look at your notes, that's fine. But if you lose your place or forget what you wanted to say, a quick look at your notes will put you back on track. Additionally, because you'll be speaking from notes instead of from a written speech, you'll be able to maintain some degree of eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your presentation.
