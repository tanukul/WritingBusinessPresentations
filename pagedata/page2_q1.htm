    <div class="pagedesc">
        <p>You have a planning meeting with Marissa. She tells you that she recommends the advice of leadership expert
            Stephen Covey: "Begin with the end in mind," meaning that good presentations have both a specific purpose and
            a specific intended outcome.</p>
        <p>"If you want your audience to know something, inform them," she says. "If you want them to believe or do something,
            persuade them. If you want them to know how to do something, instruct them."</p>
        <p>Based on Marissa's advice, which of the following best describes the purpose of your presentation?</p>
