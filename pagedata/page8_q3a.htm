            <p>As you plan your presentation, you'll need to consider what tools you want to use and what materials you can provide to help your audience understand your message.</p>
            <p>Structural Sound has over 2,000 employees at headquarters on two shifts, and you need to deliver the presentation to all of them. There are 1,400 employees on the 1st shift and 600 employees on the 2nd shift. The auditorium is large enough to accommodate all 2nd-shift employees, but it's not large enough to accommodate all 1st-shift employees at once. </p>
            <p>Given the space limitations, which of the following media and channels would be most appropriate for your presentation to the employees at Structural Sound's headquarters?</p>

                Audio podcasts are easy to listen to in a variety of environments and will be readily accessible to employees on both shifts. However, you'll lack the benefit of visual elements in a podcast, and your audience won't have an opportunity to ask questions or otherwise interact with you. Another option would have been a better choice.
