                                        Stephen Covey: "Begin with the end in mind," meaning that good presentations have both a specific purpose and
                                        a specific intended outcome.</p>
                                    <p>"If you want your audience to know something, inform them," she says. "If you want them to believe or do something,
                                        persuade them. If you want them to know how to do something, instruct them."</p>

                                <p>As you ponder how to begin preparing your persuasive presentation, you wonder how your audience will react to your presentation.</p>
                                <p>You consult with Lloyd Baskin, Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has been with the company for over 30 years, and you're confident that if anyone has insight into the mindset of Structural Sound employees, it's Lloyd.</p>
                                <p>He tells you, "People, by nature, are resistant to change, and a lot of our employees have been here for years. Many of them probably don't know what product departmentalization is, much less how they'll fit in and how it will benefit them as well as the company."</p>
                                <p>Based on Lloyd's advice, which of the following would appear to be the most accurate analysis of your audience?</p>

                                <p>As you ponder how to begin preparing your persuasive presentation, you wonder how your audience will react to your presentation.</p>
                                <p>You consult with Lloyd Baskin, Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has been with the company for over 30 years, and you're confident that if anyone has insight into the mindset of Structural Sound employees, it's Lloyd.</p>
                                <p>He tells you, "People, by nature, are resistant to change, and a lot of our employees have been here for years. Many of them probably don't know what product departmentalization is, much less how they'll fit in, and how it will benefit them as well as the company."</p>
                                <p>Based on Lloyd's advice, which of the following would appear to be the most accurate analysis of your audience?</p>

                                <p>Marissa stops by your office to ask how you're progressing on the presentation. When you tell her that you're going to incorporate some training in cross-functional team best practices, she shakes her head. "I think it's a little too early for that. Let's wait until the teams are actually formed before we start training them. I'd focus on informing them and 'selling' them a little about the reorganization."</p>
                                <p>You quickly shift gears and begin thinking about how to prepare your persuasive presentation. You wonder how your audience will react to the presentation, so you consult with Lloyd Baskin, Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has been with the company for over 30 years, and you're confident that if anyone has insight into the mindset of Structural Sound employees, it's Lloyd.</p>
                                <p>He tells you, "People, by nature, are resistant to change, and a lot of our employees have been here for years. Many of them don't know what cross-functional teams are, much less how they'll fit in, and how it will benefit them as well as the company."</p>
                                <p>Based on Lloyd's advice, which of the following would appear to be the most accurate analysis of your audience?</p>

They can also interact with you and ask questions. Additionally, by videotaping the presentation, you can make it available to employees who may be traveling on business, on vacation, or absent from work because of illness.

                                            You chose to start your presentation by asking members of the audience if they'd had a frustrating experience buying a product from a salesperson who had little product knowledge.

                                            An easy way to get your audience's attention and get them engaged is to ask them a question that is relevant to your presentation. Keep in mind that you'll now need to address how the reorganization is going to tie into the rest of your presentation, such as how the new organization is going to make them specialists in a product line.

                                            You chose to start your presentation by asking members of the audience if they'd had a frustrating experience buying a product from a salesperson who had little product knowledge.

                                            An easy way to get your audience's attention and get them engaged is to ask them a question that is relevant to your presentation. Keep in mind that you'll now need to address how the reorganization is going to tie into the rest of your presentation, such as how the new organization is going to make them specialists in a product line.            </span>

                                            Reading requires you to look at your script, not your audience, and if you do look up occasionally, it's easy to lose your place. Additionally, reading limits your interaction with the audience, and your delivery will lack a conversational tone. Another choice would have been a better option.            </span>

                                            </span>Although memorizing your speech will allow you to maintain eye contact with the audience, your speech will probably lack a conversational tone, because all spontaneity will be gone.

                                                You chose speaking extemporaneously.

                                                If you're an experienced speaker and you know your topic well, you'll be able to maintain eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your message. However, if you have a fear of public speaking, this approach isn't for you. Additionally, because your only "cue card" is your outline, the detailed points will have to come from your mind, and you may be bombarded with so many thoughts that you're likely to forget some of them or interject forgotten items later in the speech where they're no longer relevant, resulting in an unorganized delivery.                </span>
                                        </span>
                                    </p>

                                        <span class="Open-Sans-Font-16px ">
                                            You chose speaking from notes.
                                            <span style="color:#1d7527;">

                                            </span>
                                            Having notes takes the pressure off from having to remember every point, as well as the order and flow of what you are presenting. Having notes also provides you with a "security blanket." If you don't need to look at your notes, that's fine. But if you lose your place or forget what you wanted to say, a quick look at your notes will put you back on track. Additionally, because you'll be speaking from notes instead of from a written speech, you'll be able to maintain some degree of eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your presentation.

                                            Reading requires you to look at your script, not your audience, and if you do look up occasionally, it's easy to lose your place. Additionally, reading limits your interaction with the audience, and your delivery will lack a conversational tone. Another choice would have been a better option.        </p>

                                                If you're an experienced speaker and you know your topic well, you'll be able to maintain eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your message. However, if you have a fear of public speaking, this approach isn't for you. Additionally, because your only "cue card" is your outline, the detailed points will have to come from your mind, and you may be bombarded with so many thoughts that you're likely to forget some of them or interject forgotten items later in the speech where they're no longer relevant, resulting in an unorganized delivery.        </p>

                                            Having notes takes the pressure off from having to remember every point, as well as the order and flow of what you are presenting. Having notes also provides you with a "security blanket." If you don't need to look at your notes, that's fine. But if you lose your place or forget what you wanted to say, a quick look at your notes will put you back on track. Additionally, because you'll be speaking from notes instead of from a written speech, you'll be able to maintain some degree of eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your presentation.

                                                If you're an experienced speaker and you know your topic well, you'll be able to maintain eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your message. However, if you have a fear of public speaking, this approach isn't for you. Additionally, because your only "cue card" is your outline, the detailed points will have to come from your mind, and you may be bombarded with so many thoughts that you're likely to forget some of them or interject forgotten items later in the speech where they're no longer relevant, resulting in an unorganized delivery.               </span>
                                        </span>

                                            You chose speaking from notes.

                                            Having notes takes the pressure off from having to remember every point, as well as the order and flow of what you are presenting. Having notes also provides you with a "security blanket." If you don't need to look at your notes, that's fine. But if you lose your place or forget what you wanted to say, a quick look at your notes will put you back on track. Additionally, because you'll be speaking from notes instead of from a written speech, you'll be able to maintain some degree of eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your presentation.

                                                You chose speaking extemporaneously.

                                                If you're an experienced speaker and you know your topic well, you'll be able to maintain eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your message. However, if you have a fear of public speaking, this approach isn't for you. Additionally, because your only "cue card" is your outline, the detailed points will have to come from your mind, and you may be bombarded with so many thoughts that you're likely to forget some of them or interject forgotten items later in the speech where they're no longer relevant, resulting in an unorganized delivery.            </span>

                                            You chose speaking from notes.

                                            Having notes takes the pressure off from having to remember every point, as well as the order and flow of what you are presenting. Having notes also provides you with a "security blanket." If you don't need to look at your notes, that's fine. But if you lose your place or forget what you wanted to say, a quick look at your notes will put you back on track. Additionally, because you'll be speaking from notes instead of from a written speech, you'll be able to maintain some degree of eye contact with your audience and assess how they are responding to your presentation.            </span>

                                                <strong>This was one of the best choices.</strong>
                                            </span>The end of a presentation is just as important as the beginning and using a quote will often stay with the audience long after they leave the room.
                                        </span>
                                    </p>

                                                You chose giving a brief summary of your main points.

                                                    <strong>This was an OK choice.</strong>
                                                </span>However, the end of a presentation is just as important as the beginning, and you want to make your ending memorable. Another option would have been a better choice.

                                            You chose closing with an image.
                                            <span style="color:#1d7527;">

                                            The end of a presentation is just as important as the beginning, and using a powerful image will often stay with the audience long after they leave the room.            </span>
