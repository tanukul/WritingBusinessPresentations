                        <p>Structural Sound is a precision electronics company that produces innovative, high-end speakers, headphones, and other quality digital audio products at its popular stand-alone stores located in big cities and shopping malls across the United States.</p><br />
                      <p>For years, all employees at headquarters have been organized into job-specific (functional) departments, such as accounting, engineering, marketing, manufacturing, and so forth. The executive board believes that the company would benefit from reorganizing utilizing product departmentalization, in which employees will be grouped based upon product lines. Each product line (such as speakers) will operate autonomously and will have specialists in all of the functions needed to produce and sell that product, such as marketing, manufacturing, accounting, and so on.</p><br />
                    <p>Earlier this month, the board sent a memo to all employees announcing this new organizational structure and detailing the reasons for the change, including:</p>
                    <p><ol><li>Decreased product development time</li>
                        <li>Better utilization of human resources through specialization</li>
                        <li>More teamwork and better communication among groups of employees focused on a specific product line</li></ol></p>
                    <p>Employees are awaiting details on how the new structure will affect them. At the request of Marissa Thielen, Director of Human Resources, you must prepare and deliver a presentation giving employees the details they need and explaining how the organizational change will affect them.</p><br />

            <div class="pagedesc">
                <p>You have a planning meeting with Marissa. She tells you that she recommends the advice of leadership expert
                    Stephen Covey: "Begin with the end in mind," meaning that good presentations have both a specific purpose and
                    a specific intended outcome.</p>
                <p>"If you want your audience to know something, inform them," she says. "If you want them to believe or do something,
                    persuade them. If you want them to know how to do something, instruct them."</p>
                <p>Based on Marissa's advice, which of the following best describes the purpose of your presentation?</p>

                <p>As you plan your presentation, you'll need to consider what tools you want to use and what materials you can provide to help your audience understand your message.</p>
                <p>Structural Sound has over 2,000 employees at headquarters on two shifts, and you need to deliver the presentation to all of them. There are 1,400 employees on the 1st shift and 600 employees on the 2nd shift. The auditorium is large enough to accommodate all 2nd-shift employees, but it's not large enough to handle all 1​st-shift employees.</p>
                <p>Given the space limitations, which of the following media and channels would be most appropriate for your presentation to the employees at Structural Sound's headquarters?</p>
