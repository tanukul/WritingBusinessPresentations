        <div class="pagedesc">
            <p>As you ponder how to begin preparing your persuasive presentation, you wonder how your audience will react to your presentation.</p>
            <p>You consult with Lloyd Baskin, Chairman of the Executive Committee. He has been with the company for over 30 years, and you're confident that if anyone has insight into the mindset of Structural Sound employees, it's Lloyd.</p>
            <p>He tells you, "People, by nature, are resistant to change, and a lot of our employees have been here for years. Many of them probably don't know what product departmentalization is, much less how they'll fit in and how it will benefit them as well as the company."</p>
            <p>Based on Lloyd's advice, which of the following would appear to be the most accurate analysis of your audience?</p>
