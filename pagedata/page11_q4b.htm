        <div class="pagedesc">
          <p>You've previously defined the main idea or purpose of your presentation: informing the employees about the details of the reorganization and emphasizing the benefits of the reorganization for both them and the company. Now it's time to decide whether you will use a direct approach or an indirect approach in your presentation.</p>
          <p>As with other forms of communication, a direct approach arranges the content in your presentation to introduce your main point before the supporting details. An indirect approach would present the supporting information before you state your main point.</p>
          <p>Having analyzed your audience, which approach would be most appropriate for your presentation?</p>

                You chose to use a direct approach in your presentation.

                    <strong>This was not the best choice.</strong>
                </span>
                A direct approach is appropriate if the subject involves routine information or good news. The reorganization is not routine, and many employees will likely not perceive it as being "good news."

                </span>An indirect approach is appropriate if the subject involves negative news or persuasion. Given what Lloyd Baskin suggested about people being resistant to change, this approach would be most appropriate for your presentation.
