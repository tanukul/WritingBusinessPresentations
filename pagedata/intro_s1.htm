						<h1 class="scenarioheading">Scenario</h1></p>
						<p>Structural Sound is a precision electronics company that produces innovative, high-end speakers, headphones, and other quality digital audio products at its popular stand-alone stores located in big cities and shopping malls across the United States.</p><br />
                      <p>For years, all employees at headquarters have been organized into job-specific (functional) departments, such as accounting, engineering, marketing, manufacturing, and so forth. The executive board believes that the company would benefit from reorganizing utilizing product departmentalization, in which employees will be grouped based upon product lines. Each product line (such as speakers) will operate autonomously and will have specialists in all of the functions needed to produce and sell that product, such as marketing, manufacturing, accounting, and so on.</p><br />
                    <p>Earlier this month, the board sent a memo to all employees announcing this new organizational structure and detailing the reasons for the change, including:</p>
                    <p><ol><li>Decreased product development time</li>
                        <li>Better utilization of human resources through specialization</li>
                        <li>More teamwork and better communication among groups of employees focused on a specific product line</li></ol></p>
                    <p>Employees are awaiting details on how the new structure will affect them. At the request of Marissa Thielen, Director of Human Resources, you must prepare and deliver a presentation giving employees the details they need and explaining how the organizational change will affect them.</p><br />
